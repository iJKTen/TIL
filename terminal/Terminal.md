# Terminal

## Execute multiple commands
If you want to change directory and open code then you can do it like
```
cd webs;code .
```
Seperate multiple commands with a semi-colon.

## Move your cursor in Terminal with option click
I know you could select option + left / right arrow keys to move your cursor across a command but you could also select option + click to place your at a desired location.
